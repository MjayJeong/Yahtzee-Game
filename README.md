# Yahtzee Game

This project implements a single-player **Yahtzee** game in Python. The game allows players to roll dice, manage scoring categories, and calculate their final score based on Yahtzee rules.

## What is Yahtzee?
Yahtzee is a dice game where the objective is to score points by rolling five dice to make specific combinations. The game consists of 13 rounds, and players must decide which scoring category to use for each round. Each category can only be scored once.

## Features
- **Roll Dice**: Roll five dice and display the possible scores for unrecorded categories.
- **Re-roll Dice**: Choose specific dice to keep and re-roll the rest up to two times per round.
- **Score Categories**: Record scores for each category, such as Three of a Kind, Full House, or Yahtzee.
- **Final Score**: Display the final score after all 13 rounds are completed.

## How to Play
1. Start the game and roll the dice.
2. Choose to either:
   - Re-roll certain dice (up to 2 times per round).
   - Record the score for a specific category.
3. Repeat until all 13 categories are filled.
4. View the final score at the end of the game.
